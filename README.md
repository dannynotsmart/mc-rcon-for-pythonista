# mc-rcon-for-pythonista
UI designed using iOSâ€™ Pythonista App UI to connect to an Minecraft Java server console!

Extremely simple to use, but there are a few steps:
1. Install *mcrcon*. This is a package. You can install it via `pip install mcrcon` (https://pypi.org/project/mcrcon/)

2. Edit **config.py**. Change the variables to your variables.

Example:
IP = "120.0.0.1"
PASSWORD = "RconTestWoohoo!"
PORT = 8020

3. Run RCon.py!

NOTE: I have never used Github seriously so all this stuff is pretty new to me, this project serves as like a first project thing on Github. The code is bad but you can modify it to how you like!
I also don't know anything about liscences
